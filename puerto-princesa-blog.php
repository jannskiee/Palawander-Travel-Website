                    <em>Drifting through the silent, cathedral-like chambers of an ancient world.</em>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The journey began with a long drive through rural Palawan—bamboo huts, rice fields, and mountains rolling endlessly along the horizon. When we finally reached Sabang, the sea breeze and mangrove-lined shore felt like a gateway to something ancient. A small banca brought us across green water and into the mouth of one of the longest navigable underground rivers on Earth.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Inside, everything changed. The air was cold, the echo of water droplets bounced off cave walls like whispers, and my headlamp revealed cathedral-sized chambers, stalactites shaped like dripping wax or mythical creatures frozen mid-movement. Every rock formation had a story—some looked like vegetables, others like faces or altars—proof that nature has been carving its own art long before humans could dream of sculpting.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What surprised me most was the silence. Even with a boat full of tourists, there were long stretches where everyone was too stunned to speak. It felt like we were intruders in a world that didn’t belong to us—like the river was alive, watching, waiting. I have never felt so aware of time—millions of years compressed into stone.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After emerging from the darkness, Puerto Princesa revealed even more surprises: a mangrove forest glowing with fireflies at night, local eateries serving Tamilok (woodworm!) and crocodile sisig, and a community proud of both nature and culture. Puerto Princesa isn’t just an attraction—it’s an invitation to slow down, appreciate silence, and remember how vast and mysterious the earth still is.
